                MolGen/Stanford File Format

1.  The first line in a sequence file is a comment line.  This line
  begins with a semi-colon in the first space.  This line need
  not be present.  If it is present it holds descriptive text.
  There may be as many comment lines as desired at the first of
  sequence file.  (See LINE  1).

2.  The second line must be present and contains an identifier or
  name for the sequence in the first ten spaces.  (See LINE  2).

3.  The sequence begins on the third line and occupies up to eighty
  spaces.  Spaces may be included in the sequence for ease of
  reading.  The sequence continues for as many line as needed
  and is terminated with a 1 or 2.  1 indicates a linear sequence
  while 2 marks a circular sequence.  (See LINE  3 and LINE  4).

                          Example MolGen/Stanford file
